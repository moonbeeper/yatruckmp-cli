# Version 0.1.2 (2025/08/09)

Woops, seems like I forgot AGAIN to completely test the output files before releasing the first version.

- Fixed (again) a bug where the hardcoded content folder was being created in the directory where the executable is located (which may not have write permissions) instead of the AppData directory.

# Version 0.1.1 (2025/08/09)

Fixing bugs and adding a little thing because I forgotten to test it correctly before releasing the first version lol.

- Fixed a bug where the hardcoded content folder was being created in the directory where the executable was being run instead of the directory where the executable is located.
- Added a progress bar to indicate the progress (how obvious can that be?) of the current download progress.
