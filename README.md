# yet another truckers mp cli

Another simple launcher for the games that are supported by [TruckersMP](https://truckersmp.com/). It only supports Windows 64bit as that's what their launcher is built for.

## Installation

Just grab the executable in its zip or msi from the [latest release](https://github.com/moonbeeper/yatruckmp-cli/releases/latest) page.

## Usage

```sh
# run the game
truckersmp-cli run   # optionally --game <ets2 or ats>
# update the mod files
truckersmp-cli update   # optionally --game <ets2 or ats> and --clean to clean the mod files directory
# kill the game process if its running
truckersmp-cli kill   # optionally --game <ets2 or ats>
```

That's it. Quite simple isn't it?
